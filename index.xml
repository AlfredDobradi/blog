      <description>The theme I&amp;rsquo;m using for this blog is very barebones. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are existing themes like this for Hugo but when the thought of this blog formed in my head I had a few principles regarding how I want to create and maintain it. The first - and most important - point was it all has to be done by me - well all except Hugo - which includes the theme as well.</description>

      <description>Yo, this is the first post on this blog which will hopefully get better over time. I created it because recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling the itch to write about the shit that&amp;rsquo;s happening to me and to share some shit I see/hear/do.
The theme is very minimalistic, my own creation - even though it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just a decomposition if anything. If y&amp;rsquo;all like it, head over to https://vcs.brvy.win/barveyhirdman/dmdm where you can get it.</description>
