		<p>The last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of making a game quite a lot. From time to time I have this thing but I usually don&rsquo;t act on it. However&hellip; this time I started thinking about the concept I have in mind and I feel like it&rsquo;s something I could do and it would be cool as heck.</p>

<p>Without saying too much about the game and the concept (although some people I&rsquo;ve already told) it&rsquo;s relatively simple graphics-wise as it would only use plain GUI elements (text boxes, frames, charts, etc) like an accounting program. I decided to go this way for two reasons:
The first, more important one is it just fits the game&rsquo;s premise very well. The second - which is more like a side-effect than a reason - is it&rsquo;s MUCH simpler.</p>

<p>Having said all that, here comes the challenge part: I wanna finish the game as much as possible in 24 hours. Now I&rsquo;m not sure how I will do this as I&rsquo;m fairly sure coding for 24 hours is absolutely detrimental to health, so it might be sliced to two or three sessions. I intend to stream the process, but no hard promises here, for now I&rsquo;m just weighing the possibilities but I feel very strongly about this and it&rsquo;s been almost 16 hours since the inception of the idea so it&rsquo;s not an impulse anymore.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, I&rsquo;ll probably put something here when I make my mind up. I also have to flesh out some details about the concept itself.</p>
