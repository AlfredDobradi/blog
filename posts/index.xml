      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to actually do the game challenge in term of time restrictions and feasibility and my best idea so far is to have a 36 hour window in which I start with 12 hours of programming (and streaming), then do something else for 12 hours (probably sleeping lol) and finish with another 12 hour session of writing the game.
This would be good because: * I can take a break and sleep * I won&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to get ideas which result in rewriting the whole thing * It can still be handled as one event</description>

      <description>The last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of making a game quite a lot. From time to time I have this thing but I usually don&amp;rsquo;t act on it. However&amp;hellip; this time I started thinking about the concept I have in mind and I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s something I could do and it would be cool as heck.
Without saying too much about the game and the concept (although some people I&amp;rsquo;ve already told) it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple graphics-wise as it would only use plain GUI elements (text boxes, frames, charts, etc) like an accounting program.</description>

      <title>Theme Philosophy: DMDM</title>

      <description>The theme I&amp;rsquo;m using for this blog is very barebones. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are existing themes like this for Hugo but when the thought of this blog formed in my head I had a few principles regarding how I want to create and maintain it. The first - and most important - point was it all has to be done by me - well all except Hugo - which includes the theme as well.</description>

      <description>Yo, this is the first post on this blog which will hopefully get better over time. I created it because recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling the itch to write about the shit that&amp;rsquo;s happening to me and to share some shit I see/hear/do.
The theme is very minimalistic, my own creation - even though it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just a decomposition if anything. If y&amp;rsquo;all like it, head over to https://vcs.brvy.win/barveyhirdman/dmdm where you can get it.</description>
