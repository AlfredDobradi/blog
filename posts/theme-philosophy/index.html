		<p>The theme I&rsquo;m using for this blog is very barebones. I&rsquo;m sure there are existing themes like this for Hugo but when the thought of this blog formed in my head I had a few principles regarding how I want to create and maintain it. The first - and most important - point was it all has to be done by me - well all except Hugo - which includes the theme as well.</p>

<p>Even though it&rsquo;s not a complicated theme at all, when you create something it helps to develop a certain philosophy first and go with that in mind. As you can guess my main goal was creating a very simplistic theme using as few CSS rules as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use Nicholas Gallagher&rsquo;s <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">Normalize CSS</a> as a boilerplate</li>
<li>Control spacing (using <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code> and <code>width</code>)</li>
<li>Control <code>font-family</code> and <code>font-size</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a long list and the code is very minimal, come to think of it, cutting it up to 5 different scss imports was absolutely unnecessary, but I like organizing my code so whatever.</p>

<p>I chose Open Sans for the font family of the theme as it&rsquo;s a clean and very readable typeface, although I&rsquo;m not sure if I should use a serif font instead to improve readability further, which is the long-term goal. Minimalistic shouldn&rsquo;t be unreadable, right? I&rsquo;ll probably introduce better line and letter spacing over time, but I&rsquo;ve yet to find a good combination of the two. As for the sizing of the text, the reason behind changing browser defaults is just having control over it and giving it a nice big letter feel. I use 16px size in my editors and I usually prefer big line heights and large text as it&rsquo;s easier on the eye.</p>

<p>The spacing bit doesn&rsquo;t really require much explanation I assume, it&rsquo;s easier to visually separate components and I really like indents for some weird reason.</p>

<p>Long story short, I wanted a simple, minimalistic but readable theme and I wanted to do it myself, so DMDM was born. If you want to get it - to use or to build on - just head over to <a href="https://vcs.brvy.win/barveyhirdman/dmdm">https://vcs.brvy.win/barveyhirdman/dmdm</a> and give it a try.</p>
