      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to actually do the game challenge in term of time restrictions and feasibility and my best idea so far is to have a 36 hour window in which I start with 12 hours of programming (and streaming), then do something else for 12 hours (probably sleeping lol) and finish with another 12 hour session of writing the game.
This would be good because: * I can take a break and sleep * I won&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to get ideas which result in rewriting the whole thing * It can still be handled as one event</description>

      <description>The last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of making a game quite a lot. From time to time I have this thing but I usually don&amp;rsquo;t act on it. However&amp;hellip; this time I started thinking about the concept I have in mind and I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s something I could do and it would be cool as heck.
Without saying too much about the game and the concept (although some people I&amp;rsquo;ve already told) it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple graphics-wise as it would only use plain GUI elements (text boxes, frames, charts, etc) like an accounting program.</description>
