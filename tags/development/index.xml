      <description>The last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of making a game quite a lot. From time to time I have this thing but I usually don&amp;rsquo;t act on it. However&amp;hellip; this time I started thinking about the concept I have in mind and I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s something I could do and it would be cool as heck.
Without saying too much about the game and the concept (although some people I&amp;rsquo;ve already told) it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple graphics-wise as it would only use plain GUI elements (text boxes, frames, charts, etc) like an accounting program.</description>
